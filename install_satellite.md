# Install Satellite

A satellite server is the central maangent/deployment server for  
enterprise environments based on RedHat Enterprise Linux.  

In order to successfully run a satellite server You must have a license.  
If you are not in a position to buy a license, you better add the install DVD's to  
the repository server and set satellite_present to false in the inventory.  

The virtualmachine to run a satellite server must met the following  
minimum requirements:  

* memory 16GB
* 4 CPU's
* storage 60GB 
* minimum of 300GB extra storage for pulp data

If you have a license and room to spare in your lab... just follow the installation  
manuals availlable on the internet. For most people this is not economical and a   
repository server is much more cost effective.
